       <p>In the future, I aspire on going into the medical feild, and potentially become a doctor.</p>
       <p>I dream of becoming a Cardiologist. I've always wanted to become a doctor when I was younger, but now time is coming for me to make that dream a relaity.
         I study really hard and I put a lot of effort into whatever I'm doing. For the future, I've planned out my next couple years and I'm hoping that nothing comes in the way and changes a couple plans.
         1. Finish high school with honours. So far I got the bag secrued for grade 10, just pushing hard for grade 11 and 12. 2. Go straight into university and not take any breaks and get my science degree.
         3. Pass the MCAT and work hard through medical school. 4. Finish residency and graduate as an offical doctor. 5. Save up and spoil my family for all of their support.</p>
