      <p>I know I'm boring, but I do got some "fun" inside me :)  A normal school day for me would be waking up at 8:30am, taking my dog out, getting to class at 8:55am, be in class til 3:30pm with breaks in between and after school, finishng up homework, spend some time with my family and if I have any free time, I'll probably either study for my driving test or just watch some anime. A weekend say is a littledifferent for me, I wake up at around 2-3pm and eat, do homework, spend some time with family and have some free time before going to bed. Yes, I know, I'm boring. I also pray and read the bible in the morning before class as well. Feel free to listen to the video below while reading the rest! </p>

      <p>  Since I have been doing online school, I unfortunatly don't have the choice of joining in school clubs. In the past, I have joined many sports teams, almost every single one execpt soccer (not a fan) and rugby. One of my favorite clubs that wasn't a sport has to be Science Olympics, I remeber going to the Butterdome for the compettiton it was so much fun. I remember my friend and I drinking so much tea and coffee there. We didn't even like them! We also ate too many sugar packets...but anywayyy my personality type is a ISTP-T, and I usually don't agree with internet "oh what kind of __ are you," but this thing though, it is freaky accurate. I agree to all the things that it says and it really does apply to my personality. ISTP-T (introverted, observant, thinks more than feels, prospecting and turbulent)</p>

      <p>This one time in a cricket tournament, some of my teammate were a little too overconfident since we kept on beating every team. And then the finals come along, in the finals, we lost to them, it was a bummer but honestly, we could've won 100%. But some people were a little too confident because of the past wins but when we lost, it sucked to be honest. But we got second in the tournament so that's fun. I also got a "best feilder" medal along with the sliver medal. The "best all rounder" and " best batsmen" went to the other team. Someone in my team got the "best bowler." This ended up being a little bit of a rant and memory dump, oopies! The video below is some of the recorded parts from the tournament, I am the girl with the blue shirt on the grounds.#17</p>
