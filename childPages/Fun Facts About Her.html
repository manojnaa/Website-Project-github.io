I love drawing. I love music, my taste in music changes a lot. At the moment I'm into the reverbed versions of songs, rock, a lil rap and some spanish mixes. I love anime, so far my favorite I've watched has to be Naruto. 10/10 recommend. The video below is one of the main (my fav) characters. I go to W.P. Wagner High School, but I haven't gone in person to the school yet. I've been online in March, when I was in grade nine to now, grade 11. I honestly prefer online to in person schooling. I got so much more time, lot more sleep and no distractions. But I do miss in person learning. I play volleyball, badminton and cricket. I hate black pepper with a passion. A normal school day for me would be waking up at 8:30am, taking my dog out, getting to class at 8:55am, be in class til 3:30pm with breaks in between and after school, finishng up homework, spend some time with my family and if I have any free time, I'll probably either study for my driving test or just watch some anime. A weekend say is a littledifferent for me, I wake up at around 2-3pm and eat, do homework, spend some time with family and have some free time before going to bed. Yes, I know, I'm boring. I also pray and read the bible in the morning before class as well.
