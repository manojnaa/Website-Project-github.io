      <p style="font-size:3vw">I know I'm boring, but I do got some "fun" inside me :)</p>
  <p style="font-size:2.5vw">
I love drawing. I love music, my taste in music changes a lot. At the moment I'm into the reverbed versions of songs, rock, a lil rap and some spanish mixes. I love anime, so far my favorite I've watched has to be Naruto. 10/10 recommend. The video below is one of the main (my fav) characters. I go to W.P. Wagner High School, but I haven't gone in person to the school yet. I've been online in March, when I was in grade nine to now, grade 11. I honestly prefer online to in person schooling. I got so much more time, lot more sleep and no distractions. But I do miss in person learning. I play volleyball, badminton and cricket. I hate black pepper with a passion.

 <p style="font-size:2.5vw">I love Science, Biology, Chemistry and Language Arts. I also execl really well in them too, like my grades are so beautiful in them, it brings tears of joy to my eyes. But Math and Physics can leave, yup not invited here, sorry not sorry. It rages me with so many letters and numbers and word problems, man I could just go on and on why I despise them so much, ugh. Like who even likes a+b=c?! Just looking at that makes me gag. But surpriseingly, I am still keeping the borderline A in those subjects. Before, I used to hate Social Stuides, I always found politics and history so boring, but now, I'm starting to have a liking towards that. I find it so interesting, like it's super weird why I am starting to like it, I used to be so against it. I also love reading. But I hate reading comprehension exams. I put so much effort into my grades and all of my homework. I push myself to limits which I wouldn't have known about in the past, I'm glad I am. But unfortuneatly, I also procrastinate a bit too much, still get my work done on time, so it's a win-stress-rage-regret-win cycle/situation.
