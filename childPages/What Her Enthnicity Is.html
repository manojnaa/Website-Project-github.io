      <p style="font-size:3vw">I am born and from India, but also have my Canadian citizenship. So I'm both Indian and Canadian</p>
  <p style="font-size:2.5vw">My name is Manojna Tumma, I go by Manojna. This writing in my language says my name.(మనోజ్ఞ)
     My favorite Indian food has to be Birianyi. I was born in Visakhapatnam, India. My mother tongue is Telugu. The writing in my language says "I speak Telugu." నేను తెలుగు మాట్లాడతాను.
     I can also speak a little French and Spanish. I can understand Tamil a little as well. My ethnicity/religion is Chistian.
     There are a lot of sweets I love as well, I don't have a favortive because my sweet tooth loves them all. Some of the holidays I celebrate are Easter and Christmas. I don't celetebrate
     traditional Indian festivals because they are Hindu. But my favorite that I do celebrate has to be Rakhi. Its a special day for the bond of a brother and a sister.</p>
